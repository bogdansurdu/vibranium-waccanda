# vibranium-waccanda

This is a project extension done for an exercise still given out by Imperial College London's Department of Computing and as such the main part of this repository is private, making available just the code related to our open-ended additions to it. 

In case you are interested as to how the project was built, feel free to contact me and you will be granted access.
